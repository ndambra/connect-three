# connect-three
a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game

Connect Three is a little tic-tac-toe game to be played with 2 people on one device (called connect three in relation to connect 4 based on the use of tokens instead of X's and O').

The app is currently only available for Android devices. The files can be download and opened in Android Studio.

This is app to display my knowledge of a gridlayout, animating objects onto a screen based on user interaction, and using Java to store game information for a smooth game play experience.
